# Incidents static webapp

Basic CRUD developed to become familiar with Azure Static Web App, using Azure Functions as serverless API,  and Azure Cosmos DB as persistence infrastructure.

Used GitHub workflow in order to build and deploy with CD/CI.

### APIs
We can see the Node.js based Azure Functions inside the branch **_feature/vanilla-api_** , and the .NETCore based Azure Functions inside the branch **_feature/netcore_api_az_functions_**.
